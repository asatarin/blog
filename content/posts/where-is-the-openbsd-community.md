Yesterday I decided to determine where the OpenBSD community should have its
interactive communication. Options included were Google Plus, Reddit and other
social networks. The results were not surprising, with community prefer
old-style communication - mailing lists maintained by project people. Less
popular community resources see below:

* [announce@openbsd.org](https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html) - 7,228
* [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2210554563/) - 5,503
