Dru used the four tenets of a community manager definition to summarize what one
should be:

* Community advocate - Advocating for what that community has to offer,
both to its members and to those outside
* Brand evangelist - Every project needs to tell other people that it exists and to get others involved
* Savvy communicator - A community manager needs to be a good communicator for a lot of
reasons
* Community input gatherer - Be a focus point
